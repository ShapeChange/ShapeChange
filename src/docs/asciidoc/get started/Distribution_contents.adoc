= Distribution contents

[[Resources_in_the_distribution_and_resources_available_on_shapechangenet]]
== Resources in the distribution and resources available on shapechange.net

Earlier versions of ShapeChange included more resources in the
distribution package. Most of these are now simply accessed from
shapechange.net when needed. The main benefit is that improvements made
to the central files are available to everyone immediately. This page
describes both the resources in the distribution package and on
shapechange.net.

If there is a need to run ShapeChange without internet connection, you
can also download copies of the resources on shapechange.net and
redirect the references in the configuration files to your local copies.

[[Content_of_the_distribution_package]]
== Content of the distribution package

The ShapeChange distribution package contains the following files and
folders:

[cols="2,5",options="header"]
