|===

* NOTE A) This field specifies the versions of EA with which the given
ShapeChange release has been developed and tested. The release will in
most cases also work with other versions of EA (especially: versions
prior to the specified version), because the EA API as well as the
interfaces used by ShapeChange are often - but not always - backwards
compatible. Versions of EA prior to 7.5 should not be used.
* NOTE B) If you are using a different version of EA and experience
issues when executing ShapeChange, you can try exchanging the eaapi.jar
in the "lib" folder with the one provided by your version of EA (the
.jar file can be found in "\{EA installation directory}/Java API"). Make
sure to rename your eaapi.jar to the one you wish to replace, otherwise
ShapeChange-internal links to the jar (especially in the manifest of the
ShapeChange JAR file) may be broken.
* NOTE C) Identifies the version of the Saxon HE jar that is used by the
ShapeChange release. If you plan to create
xref:../targets/feature catalogue/Feature_Catalogue.adoc[feature catalogues]
or to apply
xref:../targets/Output_Targets.adoc#Apply_XSL_Transformation[XSL
transformations] to output files and would like to use Saxon as XSLT
processor, then download that version of the Saxon HE jar from the
https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.sf.saxon/Saxon-HE[official maven
repository] and copy it to the lib folder of your ShapeChange
distribution.

[[Changelog]]
== Changelog

**  Future work
*** Enhance the SQL DDL target to create a database model in an EA repository, using the UML Data Modeling Profile.
* ShapeChange 2.3.0 (17.01.2017)
**  Overview
*** The list of changes in this milestone (enhancements, fixed bugs, etc.) is available at https://github.com/ShapeChange/ShapeChange/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A%222.3.0%22%20[this link].
**  Future work
*** Updates to SQL DDL target
* ShapeChange 2.2.0 (09.11.2016)
**  Overview
*** Compute differences between two versions of an application schema and document them using HTML (xref:../targets/feature catalogue/Application_Schema_Differences.adoc[link]).
*** UML diagrams can now be added to frame-based HTML feature catalogues (xref:../targets/feature catalogue/Feature_Catalogue.adoc#Inclusion_of_UML_Diagrams[link])
*** Updated ontology target (based on ISO/IS 19150) (xref:../targets/ontology/UML_to_RDF_OWL_based_on_ISO_IS_19150_2.adoc[link])
*** Added mechanism to semantically validate a ShapeChange configuration file (xref:./Validation_of_the_Configuration.adoc#Semantic_Validation[link])
*** Model transformations now validate constraints (e.g. OCL) (xref:../transformations/Common_Transformer_Functionality.adoc#Parsing_and_Validating_Constraints[link])
*** New transformation for association classes (xref:../transformations/Association_Class_Mapper.adoc[link])
*** New XSD encoding rule to allow absence of codelist codes when transforming OCL constraints that refer to actual code values (xref:../targets/xml schema/Non_Standard_Conversion_Rules.adoc#rule-xsd-cls-codelist-constraints-codeAbsenceInModelAllowed[link])
*** Several bugfixes
**  Known issues
*** Unit testing of creating a docx feature catalogue that includes UML diagrams is disabled because the name and size of images created via the Enterprise Architect API are not stable.
**  Future work
*** Updates to ArcGIS target
*** Updates to SQL DDL target
* ShapeChange 2.1.0 (02.03.2016)
**  Overview
*** Support for multiple stereotypes and multiple values per tag (tagged
values / stereotype attributes)
**** NOTE: not all targets support this capability, by default the stereotype or value is used in these cases
*** The derivation of metadata about model elements, e.g. aliases/definition/description/codes/etc has been formalised (xref:./The_element_input.adoc#Descriptor_sources[input descriptors])
**** Support for ISO 19109:2015 has been added, too, including multi-lingual support
*** New output target: Replication XML Schema - xref:../targets/Replication_XML_Schema.adoc
**** NOTE: This target is still marked as work in progress
*** ArcGIS Workspace target supports Java 8, but relies on the Java API provided by EA 12
*** Migration of code repository to https://github.com/ShapeChange[GitHub]
**** Factored out GSIP model implementation
*** Several bugfixes
** Known issues
*** Unit testing of creating a docx feature catalogue that includes UML diagrams is disabled because the name and size of images created via the Enterprise Architect API are not stable.
** Future work
*** Model diff as an HTML report
*** Inclusion of diagrams in frame-based HTML feature catalogues
*** Revision of ontology and JSON targets
* ShapeChange 2.0.1 (02.06.2015)
** Overview
*** This release contains a number of bug fixes and updates. Several xref:../transformations/Transformations.adoc[transformations] as well as another target (xref:../targets/fol to schematron/First_Order_Logic_FOL_to_Schematron.adoc[First Order Logic 2 Schematron]) have been added as well.
**  Known issues
*** Same as for 2.0.0 release
*** In addition:
**** ArcGIS Workspace target: the target currently does not work correctly with Java 8; the next release will support Java 8 but will rely on the Java API provided by EA 12
** Beta (ongoing testing)
*** Transformations:
**** xref:../transformations/AIXM_Schema_Merger.adoc[AIXM Schema Merger]
**** xref:../transformations/Constraint_Loader.adoc[Constraint Loader]
**** xref:../transformations/First_Order_Logic_Constraint_Parser.adoc[First Order Logic Constraint Parser]
*** Targets:
**** xref:../targets/SQL_DDL.adoc[SQL DDL]
**** xref:../targets/arcgis/ArcGIS_Workspace.adoc[ArcGIS Workspace]
**** xref:../targets/fol to schematron/First_Order_Logic_FOL_to_Schematron.adoc[First Order Logic 2 Schematron]
**  Future work
*** Same as for 2.0.0 release
* ShapeChange 2.0.0 (26.01.2015)
** Overview
*** Since the last release ShapeChange has been continuously extended to support a number of additional xref:../targets/Output_Targets.adoc[output targets] as well as other capabilities important for model-driven implementations, especially model xref:../transformations/Transformations.adoc[transformations].
** Known issues
*** Unit testing of creating a docx feature catalogue that includes UML diagrams is disabled because the name and size of images created via the Enterprise Architect API are not stable.
*** Unit testing of the Profiler transformation is disabled because of an issue not yet fully understood (profiling result is correct, but the generated feature catalogue files do not always 100% match the reference files).
** Known bugs
*** The test scripts (test.bat, test.sh) still use the '-SNAPSHOT' suffix in the name of the ShapeChange jar file. The correct file name to use in the script is ShapeChange-2.0.0.jar. This will be fixed in the next release. In the meantime, you can manually update the file name in your local copy of the test script.
**  Beta (ongoing testing)
*** xref:../targets/SQL_DDL.adoc[SQL DDL target]
*** xref:../targets/arcgis/ArcGIS_Workspace.adoc[ArcGIS Workspace target]
**  Future work
*** Unit tests for the ontology target
*** Unit tests for INSPIRE encoding rule
*** Unit tests for Schematron
