A feature-specific rule may apply. In the case of a bridge, the width is the distance perpendicular to the bridge centre-line and generally in the horizontal plane. In the case of a dam, the width is the distance perpendicular to (across the) the dam crest. If no such direction of flow or use exists then (1) if the feature is irregular in shape its width is taken perpendicular to the direction of its greatest horizontal dimension (see Attribute: 'Greatest Horizontal Extent'), else (2) if the feature is regular in shape then a shape-specific rule may apply: for a rectangular feature, the length of the shorter axis; for a round feature, the diameter. : For example, the value 15.71 as the excluded upper end of the interval: [3.9 ... 15.71).</Description>
