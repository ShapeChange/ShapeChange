[[Overview]]
== Overview

To be a valid input into the mapping the application schema should
conform to ISO 19109:2005, and GML 3.2 (ISO 19136) Annex E, GML 3.3
and/or ISO/TS 19139.

In addition, extensions to these latter specifications are supported,
too, but must be activated in extended encoding rules; see
xref:../targets/xml schema/XML_Schema.adoc[here] for details.

[[Stereotypes]]
=== Stereotypes

Well-known stereotypes for the purposes of ShapeChange are those defined
in the UML specification, and in the ISO 19100-series of specifications,
specifically ISO/TS 19103:2005, ISO 19109:2005 and GML 3.2/ISO
19136:2007.

Stereotypes are not case-sensitive. The stereotypes used in the ISO
19100 standards usually start with a upper case letter, but today the
common practice is to start with a lower case letter and avoid
whitespace.

Standard aliases listed for a stereotype can be used, too. Aliases can
be xref:../get started/The_element_input.adoc[configured].

All stereotypes not listed below are ignored.

There is one additional stereotype, that can be applied to all model
elements, «retired». It can be used in UML models to indicate that a
model element has been retired and is only left in the model for
compatibility with previous versions of the model. The stereotype
currently does not have any impact on the standard ShapeChange output
targets.

In UML 1, only one stereotype per model element are supported. UML 2
introduced the capability of model elements to carry more than one
stereotype.

[[Stereotypes_of_packages]]
==== Stereotypes of packages

The standard case for packages outside of an application schema, and for
subpackages of an application schema, is that no stereotype is applied.

[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Stereotype |Aliases |Description

|«Application Schema» |«applicationSchema», «requirementsClass» |An application schema according to ISO 19109 [ISO 19109].

|«bundle» | |A package that is not an application schema and contains other packages [GSIP]. Usually mapped to no stereotype.

|«leaf» | |A package that is not an application schema and contains no packages. [ISO/TS 19103]. Usually mapped to no stereotype.

|«schema» | |A package that should be treated like «Application Schema» but does not contain feature types.

|===

[[Stereotypes_of_classes]]
==== Stereotypes of classes

The standard case for classes is that no stereotype is applied; class
instances are plain objects with identity.

The stereotype «abstract» is used by some models, but should be
avoided. If a class is abstract, this must be indicated using the UML
flag for abstractness, not the stereotype. If the stereotype is
provided, it is ignored by ShapeChange.

[cols="20%,20%,60%a",options="header",]
|===
|Stereotype |Aliases |Description

|«ADEElement» |  |Feature type in an CityGML Application Domain Extension (ADE) that contains only properties that are generic application extensions.

|«AIXMExtension» |  |Type defined in an AIXM extension schema. It extends a specific feature or object type or all feature types usually from the core AIXM schema.

|«attributeConcept» |  |An attribute concept in a feature concept dictionary (see ISO 19126). If a feature type classifier has a dependency to an attribute concept classifier and a property of the same name ShapeChange will use the documentation of the concept as the documentation of the property if the documentation of the property is empty.

|«BasicType» |  |Marks a so called basic type, which can have a simple representation in one or more target encodings. It usually is a restriction of CharacterString or Number – or a structured version thereof (e.g. "one two three four" – or any other meaningful combination of such types that is supported by a given encoding).

NOTE: This stereotype has originally been defined for use with the XML Schema target. 

[WARNING]
======
For use in internal processing ShapeChange currently identifies classes as basic types while loading the model, if:

* rule-xsd-cls-basictype is contained in the XSD encoding rule, and the UML type has the stereotype «BasicType», or
* the UML type is an object type, mixin type, or data type and has a supertype that is identified as a basic type through: 
** the previous behavior (matching rule-xsd-cls-basictype and having stereotype «BasicType»), or
** an XSD map entry being defined for the supertype which does not have its xmlTypeType and xmlTypeContent attributes both set to 'complex' – either explicitly or by using the default values, which is 'complex' for both attributes.

Attempting to identify so called basic types in the conceptual model, and especially the use of stereotype «BasicType», can be an issue if 1) XML Schema is not one of the target encodings (in which case the configuration of an XmlSchema target – potentially disabled - would be necessary to identify basic types while loading the model) and 2) one or more of the targets do not support so called basic types. 
======

RECOMMENDATION: Avoid using this stereotype in your application schema. 

In the future, each target that supports the concept of target-specific basic types should categorize classes as such when the target is executed. The JSON Schema target is an example of how this can be done. Either the model structure is analyzed (e.g. inheritance from a type that is mapped to a basic type), or an encoding specific tagged value is used.

|«CodeList» |«conceptScheme» «vocabulary» |A code list. «conceptScheme» and «vocabulary» have been used to identify collections of enumerated values that may also have relationships like 'narrower'; for encoding purposes these are treated like code lists.

|«DataType» |«request» «response» | A structured data type without identity [ISO/TS 19103]. The «request» and «response» stereotype were originally used in AFIS-ALKIS-ATKIS to distinguish data types for use in messages of services. For all encoding purposes these are treated as data types and are configured as aliases.

|«Enumeration» |  |An enumeration.

|«FachId» |  |OKSTRA feature types where instances may be referenced through symbolic links. See the https://www.okstra.de/docs/n-dokumente/n0135.pdf[OKSTRA documentation (in German)].

|«featureConcept» |  |A feature concept in a feature concept dictionary (see ISO 19126). If a feature type classifier has a
dependency to a feature concept classifier of the same name ShapeChange will use the documentation of the concept as the documentation of the feature type if the documentation of the feature type classifier is empty.

|«FeatureType» |«feature» |A feature type [ISO 19136]. Some schemas have used «Feature» so this has been added as an alias.

|«Interface» |  |A type that is not directly instantiable but is used as an abstract collection of operation attribute and relation signatures. This stereotype should usually not be used in application schemas as «interface» classes are on a different conceptual level. In the encoding these will usually be treated as if no stereotype has been set.

|«Schluesseltabelle» |  |OKSTRA Schlüsseltabellen. See the https://www.okstra.de/docs/n-dokumente/n0135.pdf[OKSTRA documentation (in German)].

|«Type» | |A standard class instances are plain objects with identity. In the encoding these will usually be treated as if no
stereotype has been set but can be useful when writing UML models (via the xref:../targets/UML_model.adoc[UmlModel target]) when classes are augmented by profile-specific tagged values. For the purposes of meta-modeling «Type» has been deprecated in UML 2 and «Interface» should be used instead.

|«Union» |  |A structured data type without identity where exactly one of the properties of the type is present in any instance [ISO/TS 19103].

|«valueConcept» |  |A nominal value concept in a feature concept dictionary (see ISO 19126). If an enumeration has a dependency to an value concept classifier and an enumerant of the same name ShapeChange will use the documentation of the concept as the documentation of the enumerant if the documentation of the enumerant is empty.

|===

[[Stereotypes_of_properties]]
==== Stereotypes of properties

The standard case for properties is that no stereotype is applied.

[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Stereotype |Aliases |Description

|«enum» |«enumerationLiteral» |Typical stereotype for attribute of a code list or enumeration. Usually mapped to no stereotype but can be useful when writing UML models (via the xref:../targets/UML_model.adoc[UmlModel target]).

|«identifier» |  |An attribute with this stereotype is used to uniquely identify class objects. For database models the attribute represents a primary key field.

|«property» |  |Typical stereotype for attribute or association role of a class that is not a code list or enumeration. Usually mapped to no stereotype but can be useful when writing UML models (via the xref:../targets/UML_model.adoc[UmlModel target]) when properties are augmented by profile-specific tagged values.

|«version» |  |If in an application schema an association role ends at a spatial object type this stereotype denotes that the value of the property is meant to be a specific version of the spatial object not the spatial object in general. [INSPIRE]

|«voidable» |  |If a characteristic of an object is not present |but may be present or applicable in the real world this can be reflected using this stereotype. This is a shorthand notation for a union type of the normal value range with a void/nil value plus an optional reason for the void/nil value. [INSPIRE]

|===

[[Stereotypes_of_dependencies]]
==== Stereotypes of dependencies

The standard case for dependencies is that no stereotype is applied. For
package dependencies without a stereotype,«import» is implied (source:
ISO 19136:2007, section E.2.1.1.1).

[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Stereotype |Aliases |Description
|«import» | |The model elements of the supplier package are imported.
|===

NOTE: ShapeChange stores package dependencies without stereotypes. In
other words, stereotypes on package dependencies are ignored (thus, it
does not matter if such a dependency has the stereotype «import»,
«include», or any other stereotype). ShapeChange determines if an
application schema has a dependency on a different application schema by
examining the target namespaces of both packages; if they are different,
the two packages belong to different application schema - otherwise,
they belong to the same schema.

[[Stereotypes_of_generalizations]]
==== Stereotypes of generalizations

The standard case for generalizations is that no stereotype is applied.
ShapeChange ignores stereotypes on generalizations.

[cols="20%,20%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Stereotype |Aliases |Description
|«disjoint» |  |The constraint added to a set of generalization relationships indicates that an instance of the parent may be an instance of one and only one of the children within the set. This is implicitly assumed to be the case.
|===

[[Tagged_Values]]
=== Tagged Values

Tagged values are used to represent additional information in the UML
model that are either specific to an encoding or which require a
name-value-pair.

The following table documents the tagged values that ShapeChange directly supports, i.e. loads from a model without having to be added via the input parameters xref:../get started/The_element_input.adoc#addTaggedValues[addTaggedValues] or xref:../get started/The_element_input.adoc#representTaggedValues[representTaggedValues].

[[OCL_Constraints]]
=== OCL Constraints

In an extension to the standard encoding rules, ShapeChange supports
also parsing of OCL constraints in the application schema (not for XMI
1.0 models, as these have no standard mechanism for representing
constraints). The supported set of expressions is documented
xref:../targets/xml schema/OCL_Conversion_to_Schematron.adoc[here].

If the UML tool does not support OCL constraints directly, constraints
may also be represented in a tagged value "oclExpressions".

[[Requirements_of_the_XML_Schema_output_target]]

GML requires that a tagged value "sequenceNumber" shall be specified for
every attribute. The value shall be an integer and be unique for all
attributes and association ends of a class. As the sequenceNumber values
are used to organize the properties of a class, this cannot be tested in
the validation step, but errors are reported during the initial
processing of the model.

ShapeChange supports a more flexible approach for sequenceNumber values
than the GML standard:

* the value may omitted in which case ShapeChange determines its own
order;
* the value may be a structured integer, e.g. values like "4.2.3".

Multiplicities and visibility are also evaluated during the initial
model read process and cannot be validated at a later stage. Any errors
and warnings are reported while reading the model.

[[Requirements_for_associations1]]
==== Requirements for associations

Navigability is evaluated during the initial model read process and
cannot be validated at a later stage. Any errors and warnings are
reported while reading the model.
