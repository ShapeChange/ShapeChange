== Overview

ShapeChange can create an ontology representation in RDF/OWL of an
application schema in UML.Â  OWL (Web Ontology Language) is a series of
knowledge representation languages for describing
ontologies-relationships among individuals and classes.

Currently, two ShapeChange targets exist for the creation of an ontology
representation. They are described briefly in the following sections,
which also link to the detailed documentation for each target.

[[UML_to_RDFOWL_based_on_the_OWS-8_encoding_rule]]
== UML to RDF/OWL (based on the OWS-8 encoding rule)

This target is the initial implementation of the process for deriving an
ontology representation from an application schema in UML. It is based
on schema conversion rules that were developed during the OGC Web
Service testbed OWS-8.

xref:./UML_to_RDF_OWL_based_on_OWS_8_encoding_rule.adoc[More
information]

[[UML_to_RDFOWL_based_on_ISO_19150-2]]
== UML to RDF/OWL (based on ISO 19150-2)

This target derives an ontology representation from an application
schema in UML based on the conversion rules defined by ISO 19150-2.

* The implementation based on ISO/IS 19150-2 is documented
xref:./UML_to_RDF_OWL_based_on_ISO_IS_19150_2.adoc[here].
It is available since ShapeChange v2.2.0.
* The implementation based on ISO/DIS 19150-2 is documented
xref:./UML_to_RDF_OWL_based_on_ISO_DIS_19150_2.adoc[here]. It
is available up until, and including to, ShapeChange v2.1.0.
