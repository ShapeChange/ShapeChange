[[Introduction]]
== Introduction

ShapeChange uses CSS to define the appearance of an HTML feature
catalogue.

[[CSS_for_Single_Page_HTML_Feature_Catalogue]]
== CSS for Single Page HTML Feature Catalogue

For a plain HTML feature catalogue (target parameter outputFormat is
*html*), CSS is embedded in the resulting HTML page.

In order to adapt this CSS, either modify the HTML page or - if you are
going to create multiple single page HTML feature catalogues with
modified styling - customize the html.xsl file (see feature catalogue
target parameter *xslhtmlFile*) directly.

[[CSS_for_Frame-Based_HTML_Feature_Catalogue]]
== CSS for Frame-Based HTML Feature Catalogue

The appearance of a frame-based HTML feature catalogue is defined by CSS
instructions that are contained in a separate file, called
'stylesheet.css'.

When creating a frame-based HTML feature catalouge, by default
ShapeChange looks for the file called 'stylesheet.css' in the folder
that contains the XSLT for the feature catalogue transformation (see
feature catalogue target parameter *xsltPath*). This CSS file is copied
to the resulting feature catalogue, more specifically into the top
directory that contains the index.html file.

In order to modify the stylesheet.css that is used by the frame-based
HTML feature catalouge, you can:

. modify the stylesheet.css in the resulting feature catalogue
. modify the stylesheet.css template that is used when a feature
catalogue is created

The second option is better if you need to create many feature
catalogues with modified CSS, or in case that you might need to create
the same feature catalogue multiple times (e.g. during model
development). You can point ShapeChange to a local directory that
contains the modified stylesheet via the target parameter *cssPath*.

[[Banner_Settings]]
=== Banner Settings

Per default, ShapeChange adds the name of the feature catalogue
(configured via target parameter *name*) as heading in the top section -
let us call it 'banner' - of the resulting HTML frame structure. If
desired, you can also add a graphical image as background of this
banner. To do so, modify the following settings in the stylesheet.css:

* *header*: add *background-image* setting with the path to the image -
either an absolute path to a location on the web, or a path relative to
the location of the stylesheet.css in the folder of the resulting
feature catalogue; example: background-image: url("./logo.png");
* *div.contentDiv*: set the *top* setting to the height of the image
(e.g. top: 300px) - for small images, pick a suitable height so that the
heading with the feature catalogue name is visible
* *h1.banner*:
** set the *height* to the height of the image (e.g. height: 300px) -
for small images, pick a suitable height so that the heading with the
feature catalogue name is visible
** the horizontal placement of the heading text can be adjusted via the
*margin-left* setting; if, for example, you want the heading to appear
right beside the image, set margin-left to the width of the image (e.g.
margin-left: 400px;)
