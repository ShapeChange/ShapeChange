[[UML_model]]
= UML model

[[Scope]]
== Scope

This target writes the selected application schemas to an Enterprise
Architect model file, more specifically to a new "class view" package
(with name following the pattern "ShapeChangeOutput-" + <timestamp>)
added to the first model package found in that file. The capability is
mainly useful for generating a physical model of schemas that have been
processed using one or more
xref:../transformations/Transformations.adoc[transformations].

[[Stereotype_mappings]]
== Stereotype mappings

(Since v2.6.0)

You should use stereotype mappings to ensure that the model elements
written to the UML model are assigned to the correct UML Profile / MDG.

Without such a mapping, EA may automatically map the stereotype written
by ShapeChange to a stereotype from an arbitrary UML Profile / MDG. The
mapping is based on equality (ignoring case) of the unqualified
stereotype name. The mapping performed by EA can lead to undesired
results. For example, the stereotype 'featuretype' (which is one of the
xref:../application schemas/UML_profile.adoc#Stereotypes[stereotypes
that are well-known to ShapeChange]) could be mapped to the stereotype
'FeatureType' of the GML MDG, resulting in an element with qualified
stereotype 'GML::FeatureType'. If, instead, you wanted to ensure that it
is mapped to stereotype 'featureType' from your UML Profile / MDG, you
should add a map entry to the configuration.

NOTE: You also need to ensure that your UML Profile / MDG is available
and active in the EA environment in which you execute ShapeChange. To do
so, import the MDG with EA - to a template EA repository which is used to write
the model (see target parameter
xref:./UML_model.adoc#eaTemplate[_eaTemplate_])
and/or use 'Import To User', i.e. install the MDG locally.

NOTE: Enterprise Architect v15.2 ignores the stereotype 'application schema', i.e. a stereotype
with this name is not created in the model. Such a case can occur if you
run ShapeChange with standard stereotype aliases, resulting in the application
schema package having the well-known stereotype 'application schema'. It is 
unclear why EA behaves this way; maybe it is due to the stereotype definition of
the built-in GML MDG technology, which defines 'application schema' as alias
for the 'ApplicationSchema' stereotype. If you map 'application schema' to a different
name, such as 'applicationSchema', the stereotype should be created by EA.
'applicationSchema'

For further details on configuring these mappings, see the
xref:./UML_model.adoc#Map_Entries[Map Entries
section], and especially the information about param _stereotype._

[[Configuration]]
== Configuration

[[Overview]]
=== Overview

The Enterprise Architect UML model target in ShapeChange is configured
using the standard <Target> element.

The following is a sample <Target> definition:

[source,xml,linenumbers]
----------
<Target class="de.interactive_instruments.shapechange.ea.target.uml.UmlModel" mode="enabled" inputs="Profile">
  <targetParameter name="modelFilename" value="output/Profile.qea"/>
</Target>
----------

As for all targets, the "inputs" attribute may be used to specify that a
model that is the result of a
xref:../transformations/Transformations.adoc[transformation] is used as
input model for this target.

[[Parameters]]
=== Parameters

[[documentationNoValue]]
==== documentationNoValue

(since v2.0.2)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: none

Explanation: If a descriptor is used in the documentation template, but
has no value, this parameter will be used. See
xref:../get started/The_element_input.adoc#Descriptor_sources[here]
for more information about descriptors.

[[documentationTemplate]]
==== documentationTemplate

(since v2.0.2)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: \[[definition]]

Explanation: The template for the documentation that is placed in the
notes field in the EA model. The patterns "\[[descriptor]]" will be
replaced by the value of the descriptor, or the value of
documentationNoValue, if the descriptor has no value for the model
element. See
xref:../get started/The_element_input.adoc#Descriptor_sources[here]
for more information about descriptors.

[[eaAuthor]]
==== eaAuthor

(since v2.9.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: _none_

Explanation: Value for the field 'Author' of an EA element created while
encoding the UML model.

[[eaStatus]]
==== eaStatus

(since v2.9.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: _none_

Explanation: Value for the field 'Status' of an EA element created while
encoding the UML model.

[[eaTemplate]]
==== eaTemplate

(since v2.6.0)

+++Alias:+++ eapTemplate (this was the parameter name in ShapeChange v2.x)

+++Required / Optional:+++ optional

+++Type+++: String

+++Default Value+++: _none_

+++Explanation+++: Path to the EA repository template file (can be local or an
online resource).

If the output file (location and name are defined by the parameters
outputDirectory and modelFilename) does not exist, the default behavior
of this target is to create a new EA repository.

However, if writing the model requires a specific UML Profile / MDG to
be available, this would fail if it is not configured in the EA
environment where ShapeChange is executed. In that situation, you would
want the UML Profile / MDG loaded into the EA repository to which the
model is written. Such a repository can be provided as a template, and
configured to be used by ShapeChange via the parameter _eaTemplate_.

+++Applies to Rule(s)+++: _none â€“ general behaviour_

[[ignoreTaggedValuesRegex]]
==== ignoreTaggedValuesRegex

(since 2.9.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String (with regular expression)

Default Value: _none_

Explanation: A tagged value that matches the regular expression defined
by this parameter will not be written to the EA repository.

[[includeAssociationOwnership]]
==== includeAssociationOwnership

(since 2.9.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: If set to true, then ownership of an association role will
be encoded. A role is either owned by the association or by a class (the
class at the other end of the association). In a UML class diagram,
ownership by the class is depicted by small filled dot at the
association role.

[[mergeConstraintCommentsIntoText]]
==== mergeConstraintCommentsIntoText

(since 2.9.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: Set this parameter to true, to merge any comment defined
for an OCL constraint into the constraint text. ShapeChange supports
comments in OCL constraints within java-like comment delimiters: /* and
*/. Comments may be added to or defined for an OCL constraint via an
external source, such as a model transformation or in SCXML via the
<description> element of an <OclConstraint> element. Merging means that
any comment which is not already contained in the text of the OCL
constraint will be prepended to the constraint text, within java-like
comment delimiters.

[[modelFilename]]
==== modelFilename

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: ShapeChangeExport.qea

Explanation: The Enterprise architect EA repository file to which the application
schema(s) are written.

[[omitOutputPackage]]
==== omitOutputPackage

(since v2.10.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: Can be used to prevent the addition of a new class view
package as child of the root model (package). That new package is
typically added by ShapeChange to store the output of the target
execution.

[[omitOutputPackageDateTime]]
==== omitOutputPackageDateTime

(since v2.5.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: Can be used to prevent the addition of the timestamp to the
new class view package that is added to the model by ShapeChange.

[[outputDirectory]]
==== outputDirectory

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: none

Explanation: The path to the folder in which the resulting UML model
will be created.

[[outputPackageName]]
==== outputPackageName

(since v2.10.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: String

Default Value: ShapeChangeOutput

Explanation: Define the name of the output package that will be added by
ShapeChange as child of the root model package (unless parameter
xref:./UML_model.adoc#omitOutputPackage[omitOutputPackage]
is set to true). The current date and time will be added to that name
(unless parameter
xref:./UML_model.adoc#omitOutputPackageDateTime[omitOutputPackageDateTime]
is set to true).

[[preservePackageHierarchy]]
==== preservePackageHierarchy

(since v2.10.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: If set to true, the package hierarchy within schemas
selected for processing, and also above such schemas, is preserved.

NOTE: If set to true, and parameter
xref:./UML_model.adoc#omitOutputPackage[omitOutputPackage]
is also true, ShapeChange will check if the root package P_S of the
model that is being processed has the same name as the root model
package P_M of the EA repository to which the target writes. In that
case, the root model package P_M will be used as-is, and no additional
package will be created to represent P_S.

[[synchronizeStereotypes]]
==== synchronizeStereotypes

(since v2.10.0)

Required / Optional: optional

Type: Boolean

Default Value: false

Explanation: true, if stereotypes from UML profiles (defined using
stereotype map entries) shall automatically be synchronized at the end of
processing, else false.

[[Map_Entries]]
=== Map Entries

<mapEntries> contain individual <MapEntry> elements, which for this
target contain information for mapping specific stereotypes.

Example:

[source,xml,linenumbers]
----------
<mapEntries>
 <MapEntry type="application schema" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::applicationSchema"
 param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="featuretype" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::featureType" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="type" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::type" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="datatype" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::dataType" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="union" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::union" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="codelist" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::codeList" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="enumeration" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::enumeration" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="property" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::property" param="stereotype"/>
 <MapEntry type="enum" rule="*" targetType="ShapeChange::enum" param="stereotype"/>
</mapEntries>
----------

A <MapEntry> element contains the attributes described in the following
sections.

[[type]]
==== type

Required / Optional: Required

Explanation: Typically the UML type/class name to be mapped, however:

* The target currently does not perform a mapping of the UML type/class
name.
* Since v2.6.0, the target can map the name of a stereotype. The 'type'
of a stereotype mapping (indicated by attribute 'param' having the value
'stereotype') must be one of the
xref:../application schemas/UML_profile.adoc#Stereotypes[stereotypes
that are well-known to ShapeChange].

[[rule]]
==== rule

Required / Optional: Required

Explanation: The encoding rule to which this mapping applies. May be "*"
to indicate that the mapping applies to all encoding rules.

[[targetType]]
==== targetType

Required / Optional: Required

Explanation: Mapping target for the model element identified by
attribute 'type'. If the map entry is a stereotype mapping (indicated by
attribute 'param' having the value 'stereotype'), the target typically
is a qualified name of a stereotype, following the pattern
\{YourProfile}::\{targetStereotype}.

[[param]]
==== param

Required / Optional: Optional

Explanation: Defines one or more parameters for the mapping.

Each parameter has a name. A list of parameters is separated by commas.
Each parameter can also have characteristics defined for it, providing
even further information for the conversion. Characteristics for a
parameter are provided within curly braces. A characteristic is either
provided by identifier only, or by a key-value pair, with the key being
the identifier of the characteristic.

Example(s):

* stereotype

Supported parameters, their interpretation as well as characteristics
are described in the following sections.

[[Parameter_stereotype]]
===== Parameter: stereotype

(since v2.6.0)

Explanation: Identifies the map entry as a stereotype mapping.

Characteristics: _none_
