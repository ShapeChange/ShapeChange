= Distribution contents

[[Resources_in_the_distribution_and_resources_available_on_shapechangenet]]
== Resources in the distribution and resources available on shapechange.net

The resources needed to execute ShapeChange are contained
in the distribution package, to ensure:

* that ShapeChange can be run without an internet connection, and 
* that the execution uses the correct resources; those with which
the particular version of ShapeChange was developed.
** This helps avoiding issues with incompatible resources being used.

The resources for the latest release of ShapeChange are also available
on shapechange.net.

The following table describes the resources in both the 
distribution package and on shapechange.net.
